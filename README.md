# Parallel Lightweight Cryptography
An investigation into parallelising lightweight cryptographic algorithms submitted to the NIST LWC competition. Part of my final year Computer Science Project.

## Program
The program compiles and executes the algorithms, and then uploads the results for verification and comparison.

## App
The application is an AWS serverless backend which is used to hold the results from running the program.

## Website
The website displays the results stored in the database.
